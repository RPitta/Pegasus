# What is the Pegasus Project?

The Pegasus project is an opensource (GPLv3) suite of tools that facilitate the creation, administration and enjoyment of a text based gaming environment.  Below you'll find a list of things on the roadmap, but suffice it to say that with any mu* server base that's available, there's always a need for good, dependable, standardized tooling that allows administrators and players to customize their experience.  As Pegasus develops, more of the ideology behind it will be explored - watch for updates!

# How do I contribute?

I've been getting this question lately and the answer to that is in [The Code Contributor's Manifesto](https://github.com/taladan/Pegasus/wiki/Contribute)<sup>_(Queue the scary music, Dave)_</sup>.


#### Info coming soon

I will be migrating this stuff to the project board_settings as I get time.
Some of this may not make the cut.
